Week 1, Day 1

Lab Git Oriana Genolet 

Instructions 

First of all, install git if you don't have it yet, and create a GitHub account. (_In case you haven't made it to the bonus section in the Prework, refer to the lesson "Install Git and Create GitHub Account", that you will find there. Follow the guidelines given there. Additionally, you can use these resources: [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Version control with git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)_)

Create a new repository in GitHub. Name it `Iron`+ your name. Example: if your name is _Alvaro_, you will name the repo `IronAlvaro`.

Clone that repo to your computer.

Create a file in that folder. Name it `about.txt` and add a fun fact about yourself. (_You can use the command line: `touch nameOfTheFile.txt`_).

Add the file you just created to git.

Commit the change.

Add the file you just created to the git.

Commit the changes.

Push the changes to the GitHub and check your repository to make sure everything is there.

For the second part of the lab I forked Yadongs repository, cloned it into my Week1, Day1 folder, branched it, made the changes, (Oriana.txt file), added, committed and pushed the changes and then I made the pull request. Yadong did the same with my repository, now I have her file and she has mine. I actually didnâ€™t write the code because at some point I did a clear and I forgot to paste it. But here is the link to my repository first, and then to Yadongs repository.
